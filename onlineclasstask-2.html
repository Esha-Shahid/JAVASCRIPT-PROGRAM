    <h1>Task 2:let numbers = [21, 45, 100, 12, 11, 78, 61, 4, 39, 22]; Write a program that first writes out all these
        numbers on the console, then only those that are even (hint: the remainder of dividing an even number by 2 is
        equal to 0), then only those that are larger than 10 and at the same time smaller than 60.</h1>
